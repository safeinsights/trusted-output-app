# Welcome to the trusted output app


## This application is responsible for:
- Receiving a CSV file from the research container with the results of the code run
- Saving that CSV to memory (TBD) for the lifespan of this container
- Allowing members(TM) to log in and approve the results of the code run (AKA the CSV files)
- Once the members approve the results, this application will post the CSV file to the management app (Endpoint TBD)
